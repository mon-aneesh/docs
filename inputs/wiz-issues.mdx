## Details
This input connects to the Wiz API to fetch issues data. On first connection, it performs a complete sync of all issues. After the initial sync, it automatically switches to incremental updates, only fetching new or modified issues to optimize performance and resource usage.

## Prerequisites
Before connecting to Wiz, you need:
- Wiz API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- Appropriate permissions to access Issues API endpoints
- Access to view and list issues in your Wiz account
- Find your tenant data center on the Tenant Info page in Wiz, or request it from your Wiz customer contact. e.g., "us1", "us2", "us3".

## Configuration
The following configuration defines the input parameters:

NOTE: if you change the configuration of a component in a pipeline it will not reset its state. 
For example, if you set the project filter the incremental sync will start to pull only for the desired project but you will not get a new FULL sync of all historical data for that project.

## API

To create a Wiz Issues Connector, send a POST request:

NOTE: This curl command will create new secrets. If you wish to use and existing secret you've already created you can pass the id filed instead of name, value, and description.
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '{base_url}/api/v1/{org_id}/inputs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{

## Data Collection
The input collects the following data from Wiz Issues:

- Issue details and metadata
- Associated resources and entities
- Security findings and vulnerabilities
- Remediation information
- Status and severity levels
- Framework categories and stack layers
- Project associations
- Service ticket information (if available)

## Filtering Options
You can filter the collected issues using various criteria:

- **Severity Levels**: Filter by issue severity
- **Status**: Include only issues in specific states
- **Type**: Filter by issue type
- **Framework Categories**: Filter by security framework categories
- **Stack Layers**: Filter by affected stack layers
- **Projects**: Limit to specific projects
- **Service Tickets**: Filter based on ticket association
- **Remediation**: Filter based on remediation availability

## Notes
- The test connection functionality will alert you if your filter is too strict and no data is gathered using it.
