title: GitHub Enterprise Audit Logs
description: Collect audit logs from your GitHub Enterprise organization using the GitHub Audit Log API
---

## Prerequisites

Before configuring this input, you need to:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)** - _[github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)_:
    - Go to your GitHub settings
    - Navigate to Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
    - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
    - Select the `read:audit_log` scope
    - Copy and securely store the generated token

2. **Required Permissions**:
    - You must be an enterprise admin to access enterprise audit logs
    - The PAT must have the `read:audit_log` scope

## Configuration

### Settings

| Setting | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| enterprise | string | Yes | - | Your GitHub enterprise slug or ID |
| include | string | Yes | "all" | Type of events to include: "web" (non-git events), "git" (git events), or "all" |
| created_after | timestamp | No | - | Only return audit log entries after this timestamp |
| actor | string | No | - | Filter by the username that initiated the action |
| actions | array | No | - | Filter by specific actions or action patterns (e.g., ["repo.create", "team.*"]) |
| organization | string | No | - | Filter by organization name |
| repository | string | No | - | Filter by repository (format: org-name/repo-name) |
| country | string | No | - | Filter by actor's country code (e.g., "US") |
| user | string | No | - | Filter by the username that was affected by the action |

### Secrets

| Secret | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| personal_access_token | string | Yes | GitHub Personal Access Token with read:audit_log scope |

## Important Notes About Filtering

When using filters, be aware that:

1. **Missing Data Fields**: Not all audit log entries contain all fields. If you filter on a field that isn't present in a record, that record will be excluded. For example:
    - If you filter by `country: "US"` but an event doesn't include actor location data, that event won't be captured
    - Some events may not have an affected user, so filtering by `user` would exclude those events

2. **Action Patterns**: The `actions` filter supports both exact matches and wildcards:
    - Exact match: `"repo.create"`, `"team.add_member"`
    - Wildcard: `"repo.*"` (all repository events), `"team.*"` (all team events)

3. **Case Sensitivity**: Some fields are case sensitive:
    - Organization and repository names are case sensitive
    - Country codes are case insensitive (both "US" and "us" work)
    - 
## Created After Timestamp Behavior

Initial Run:
When a pipeline starts for the first time with no existing state (never processed any records),
it will use the provided 'created_after' timestamp as the starting point.

Subsequent Runs:
When modifying the 'created_after' field of an existing pipeline:

1. The input compares two timestamps:
   - The provided 'created_after' timestamp
   - The pipeline's current state timestamp (tracked from the most recent record processed)

2. It chooses the LATER timestamp:
   - If 'created_after' is more recent → Uses 'created_after'
   - If state timestamp is more recent → Uses state timestamp

**Example:**
Pipeline has processed records up to January 15th (state timestamp)
- Setting created_after to January 10th → Uses January 15th (state wins)
 - Setting created_after to January 20th → Uses January 20th (created_after wins)

This ensures the input never reprocesses data it has already seen and maintains forward progress.

## API

To send a `POST` request to create this Google Workspace Connector:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
 '{base_url}/api/v2/{org_id}/inputs' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{
 "config": {
   "secrets": {
     "personal_access_token": {
       "name": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
       "description": "GitHub PAT for API authentication",
       "value": "your-pat-token"
     }
   },
   "settings": {
     "enterprise": "enterprise-slug",
     "include": "all"
   }
 },
 "name": "GitHub Enterprise Audit Logs",
 "type": "github-audit-logs"
}'
```
## Limitations

- API rate limits apply (1,750 requests per hour per user/token)
- Maximum of 100 results per page
- Secondary rate limits may apply for high-frequency requests
- Historical data availability depends on your GitHub Enterprise retention settings

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### 1. Rate Limit Errors
- The input automatically handles rate limiting by waiting for the reset period
- You'll see logs indicating the wait time when rate limits are hit
- It is possible that the speed at which you generate records exceed how fast Monad can ingest them due to Github's rate limits. 
In these scenarios you may wish to filter more granular.

### 2. Authentication Errors
- Verify your PAT has the `read:audit_log` scope
- Ensure the PAT hasn't expired
- Confirm you have enterprise admin access

### 3. No Data
- Check if your filters might be too restrictive
- Verify that the enterprise slug/ID is correct
- Ensure there are audit events in the time range you're querying


## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
