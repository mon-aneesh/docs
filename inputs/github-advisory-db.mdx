## API

To send a `POST` request to create this GitHub Advisory DB Connector:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '{base_url}/api/v2/{org_id}/inputs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    "settings": {}
  },
  "description": "input_description",
  "name": "input_name",
  "promise_id": "",
  "type": "github-advisory-db"
}'  
```

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
