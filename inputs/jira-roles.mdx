title: Jira Application Roles
description: >
  Returns all application roles. In Jira, application roles are managed using the Application access configuration page - https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/give-users-access-to-products

## Details

Monad uses the `cron` field to schedule the input at specific intervals, returning all users, including active users, inactive users and previously deleted users that have an Atlassian account. A full data sync is performed each time.

## Prerequisites
Before you connect Monad to Jira, you need an API token, email, and a domain:

1. Log in to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens.

2. Select Create API token.

3. Give your API token a name that describes what it does.

4. Select an expiration date for the API token.

5. Token expiration is 1 to 365 days*

6. Select Create.

7. Select Copy to clipboard, then paste the token to your script, or save it somewhere safe.

8. Your domain name is the unique subdomain of your Jira instance. If your Jira URL is 'acme.atlassian.net', then 'acme' is the domain name.

9. The email address is the one associated with your Atlassian account used to access Jira.

***Note:** When generating an API Token, please be mindful of its expiry date, as the token and its expiry is not generated by Monad. If the token expires, any inputs relying on it will result in errors. To continue, you will need to regenerate a new API Token through the UI.
