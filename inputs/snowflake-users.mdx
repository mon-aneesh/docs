title: Snowflake Users
description: >
  List all users in the system.

## Details
Monad uses the `cron` field to schedule the input at specific intervals, returning all users across the account. 

## Prerequisites

1. You must have a snowflake account and access to creating a service account user, create a role and assign it.
2. Monad uses key pair authentication you can follow the Snowflake docs on how to set this up [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth). Be sure to have your private and public keys handy.
3. Create a new snowflake service account user with the following command
```sql
CREATE USER monad_service_account
    COMMENT = 'Service account for monad snowflake output'
    type = 'service'
    RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='Your RSA Public Key';
```
4. We need to create a new role for this service account.
```sql
-- Create a custom role for the service account
CREATE ROLE monad_service_account_role;

-- To see the full user output, the active role must have MANAGE GRANTS priveledge. Else, snowflake nulls certain fields in the output.
GRANT MANAGE GRANTS ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE TEST_ROLE;

-- Grant the role to the service account
GRANT ROLE monad_service_account_role TO USER monad_service_account;
```
