### Details
Monad uses the `cron` field to run this input on specific intervals and returns all deployments, performing a full sync of data each time.
### Prerequisites
- Before you connect Monad to Semgrep, you need an API token. API tokens are scoped to include all code findings from a specific account in Semgrep.
- Please make sure that your account is on [Semgrep Code Team tier](https://semgrep.dev/docs/usage-and-billing#integrations-and-notifications) to have access to the API endpoints.
- To generate a new Semgrep API key,
- Log in to Semgrep, and check to confirm which account you are using. If needed, switch to the account that you want to connect to Monad.
- Click Settings > Tokens > Create new token.
- In the dialog that appears, make sure that WebAPI is selected and Agent (CI) is deselected in the Token Scopes section: [Semgrep setup documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#section/Authentication)
- In the Description, enter something like Monad Connector token so that it's clear later what this token is for.
- Copy the Secrets Value (the token value) to a secure place so you can use it to set up the connector. Once you close this dialog, you cannot view the token value again.

  "config": {
    "secrets": {
        "api_key": {
         "name": "Semgrep API Key",
         "description": "API key for Semgrep authentication",
         "value": "semgrep_api_key"
       }
    },
    "settings": {

  "description": "input_description",

}'
```

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
