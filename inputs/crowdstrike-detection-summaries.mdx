title: Crowdstrike Detect Summaries
description: >
  Collects and summarizes detection events from CrowdStrike, providing insights into identified threats and their severity.
---

## Details
Monad uses the `created_timestamp` as a part of the `filter` on the [api](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/crowdstrike/reference/querydetects-1) to determine what summaries to display. This field is updated every time a request to get detection summaries is successful with the last time a request to get summaries was initiated. If this was the first time requesting for detection summaries, a full sync of the data is performed.
## Prerequisites
- Before you connect Monad to CrowdStrike, you need a Client ID and Client Secret. Log in to [falcon.crowdstrike.com](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/) and under Support & Resources, click on 'API Client and Keys' to create your credentials.
- Enter a Client Name, Description and API Scopes to define the API client. Ensure read roles for Detections are enabled.
- Click **Done**.
- Copy the ClientID and ClientSecret key. You'll need them when you set up the Monad connector.

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
