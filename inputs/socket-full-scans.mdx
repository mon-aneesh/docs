## Details
Monad uses the Socket.dev API to fetch returns the latest, available alert data for artifacts in all full scans in your org. The `from` query parameter is applied to retrieve only the scans that were detected or updated after the last successful sync. If this is the first time connecting to the Socket.dev API, Monad performs a full sync of all possible scans.

## Prerequisites
- Before connecting Monad to Socket.dev, you need to obtain an API Key and access to an Org Slug, which is obtained by Installing Socket's GitHub app from https://socket.dev. These credentials allow access to Monad to fetch Full Scans data for you.
- To access this connector, make sure your credentials have the `full-scans:list` and `repo:list` permissions.
