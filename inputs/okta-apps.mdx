### Details
Monad uses the `cron` field to run this input on specific intervals and returns all applications' details, performing a full sync of data each time.
### Prerequisites
- Before you connect Monad to Okta, you need an API token. API tokens are scoped to include all applications from a specific account in Okta.
- Instructions [Here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/).
- Get your Okta organization name: 
- In most cases, your organization name is simply your company name. However, you can also extract the organization name from your url.
- Go to the Okta admin dashboard.
- Extract your Okta org name from your url. If your url is https://companyname-admin.okta.com/admin/dashboard then your org. name is companyname. There are some slight variations on the Org.
- URLs so it could be that your URL could be https://companyname.okta.com or https://companyname.okta-emea.com. Still your org name in those cases would be companyname.
- More details and edgecases mentioned [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/#org-urls).

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
