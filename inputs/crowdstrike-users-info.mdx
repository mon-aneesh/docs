title: Crowdstrike Users Info
description: >
    Collects user information from CrowdStrike, including user profiles and activity logs. This provides visibility into user activities and helps in detecting anomalous behavior

## Details
Monad uses the `cron` field to run this input on specific intervals and returns all users, performing a full sync of data each time.
## Prerequisites
- Before you connect Monad to CrowdStrike, you need a Client ID and Client Secret. Log in to [falcon.crowdstrike.com](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/) and under Support & Resources, click on 'API Client and Keys' to create your credentials.
- Enter a Client Name, Description and API Scopes to define the API client. Ensure read roles for User Management are enabled.
- Click **Done**.
- Copy the ClientID and ClientSecret key. You'll need them when you set up the Monad connector.

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
