title: Duo Security Admin Logs
description: >
 Returns a list of administrator log events from Duo Security.
---

## Details
Monad uses the `mintime` on the [api](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#logs) to determine what logs to display. This field is updated every time a request to get admin logs is successful with the last time a request to get the logs was initiated. If this was the first time requesting for admin logs, a full sync of the data is performed.

## Prerequisites

***Before you connect Monad to Duo Security, you need an Integration Key, Secret Key, and a Host.*** 

1. [Sign up for a Duo account](https://signup.duo.com/) if you aren't already a customer.
2. [Log in to the Duo Admin Panel](https://admin.duosecurity.com/login?next=%2F) and navigate to Applications â†’ Protect an Application.
3. Locate the entry for Admin API in the applications list. Click Protect to the far-right to configure the application and get your **integration key, secret key, and API hostname.**

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
