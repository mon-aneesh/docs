title: Google Workspace Users Input
description: Collect Google Workspace Users data from your Google Workspace Users API
---

## Prerequisites

Before configuring this input, you need to set up a Google Cloud service account and grant it the necessary permissions in your Google Workspace environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Create a new project or select an existing one.

2. **Enable the Admin SDK API**:
    - In your project, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
    - Search for "Admin SDK API" and enable it.

3. **Create a Service Account**:
    - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
    - Click "Create Service Account".
    - Give it a name and description.
    - For role, you don't need to grant any roles in Google Cloud.
    - Click "Create and Continue", then "Done".

4. **Generate a Key for the Service Account**:
    - In the service account list, click on your new service account.
    - Go to the "Keys" tab.
    - Click "Add Key" > "Create new key".
    - Choose JSON as the key type and click "Create".
    - Save the downloaded JSON file securely.

5. **Set up Domain-Wide Delegation**:
    - Go to your [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/).
    - Navigate to Security -> Access and Data Control -> API Controls.
    - In the "Domain-wide Delegation" section, click "Add new".
    - For "Client ID", enter the service account's Client ID (found in the JSON key file).
    - For scopes, enter: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
    - Click "Authorize".

6. **Create and Configure an Admin Account**:
    - In the Google Workspace Admin Console, go to Users.
    - Click on "Add new user" to create a new account, or select an existing user.
    - Fill in the required information for the new user.
    - After creating the user, click on the user's name to access their details.
    - In the user details page, find the "Admin roles and privileges" section.
    - Click on "Assign roles".
    - Navigate to "Admin roles" under the Account section.
    - Click "Create new role".
    - Name the role (e.g., "User Data Reader").
    - Under privileges, expand the "Users" section.
    - Check the box for "Read" under "Users".
    - Save the new role.
    - Return to the user's details and assign this new custom role.

## Configuration

The Google Workspace Users Input is configured using the following settings:

#### Settings

| Setting | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| Email | string | Yes | The email address of the Google Workspace admin to impersonate for API calls. |
| Cron | string | Yes | A cron expression defining how often to fetch user data. |

#### Secrets

| Secret | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| CredentialsJSON | string | Yes | Base64-encoded JSON credentials of the Google Cloud service account used for authentication. |
| CustomerID | string | No | Google Workspace Customer ID. If provided, it will pull data on all users in all domains of your Google Workspace account. This should be set if Domain is not set. |
| Domain | string | No | Domain name your users belong to. If provided, it will only pull user data for users that belong to that domain. This should be set if CustomerID is not set. |

## API

To send a `POST` request to create this Google Workspace Connector:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
 '{base_url}/api/v2/{org_id}/inputs' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{
 "config": {
   "secrets": {
     "credentials_json": {
       "name": "Google Workspace Credentials",
       "description": "Google service account credentials JSON",
       "value": "credentials_json"
     }
   },
   "settings": {
     "email": "email_id",
     "cron": "your_cron_for_scheduled_ingest"
   }
 },
 "description": "input_description",
 "name": "input_name",
 "promise_id": "",
 "type": "google-workspace-users"
}'
```

## Functionality

This input component performs the following actions:

1. Authenticates with Google Workspace using a service account and admin impersonation.
2. Periodically fetches user data based on the provided cron schedule.
3. Processes and publishes user data to the pipeline for further handling.

## Best Practices

1. **Service Account**: Use a dedicated service account for this input.
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions to the service account.
3. **Admin Impersonation**: Use a dedicated admin account for impersonation, preferably one with limited permissions.
4. **Credential Security**: Keep the service account JSON key secure and never commit it to version control.
5. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review the service account's access and the impersonated admin's permissions.
6. **Cron Schedule**: Set an appropriate cron schedule based on your data freshness requirements and API quota limits.

## Limitations

- The input fetches user data in pages, with a maximum of 500 results per page (default Google API limit).
- API quotas and limits apply as per Google Workspace Admin SDK guidelines.

## Troubleshooting

- For authentication errors, verify the service account credentials and Domain-Wide Delegation setup.
- If encountering "permission denied" errors, check the impersonated admin's privileges.
- If no data is being fetched, verify the CustomerID or Domain settings in your configuration.

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "Email": "admin@yourdomain.com",
    "Cron": "0 */6 * * *"
  },
  "secrets": {
    "CredentialsJSON": "base64 encoded JSON credentials",
    "CustomerID": "C01234567",
    "Domain": "yourdomain.com"
  }
}
```

Ensure you replace `admin@yourdomain.com` with your actual admin email, adjust the cron schedule as needed, and provide the correct base64-encoded service account key. Set either CustomerID or Domain based on your requirements.

Remember to keep your service account key confidential and never commit it to version control systems.

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
