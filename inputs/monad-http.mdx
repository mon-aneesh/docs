title: Monad Http
description: The Http input allows data to be sent to the Monad API and routed to any pipeline.
---

## Details
The HTTP input is an extremely flexible method for ingesting data into the Monad platform.  By creating an Http input, users can publish any data they wish to a pipeline without needing to have a specifically implemented input to support that data.  This allows data to be sent via any programming language or even via curl as a starting point.



## Prerequisites
  There are no Prerequisites to start using the Http input.  Simply create an Http Input and attach it to a pipeline.

## Sending data
  Sending data to an Http input requires sending a POST request to the Monad API with the correct headers and in the proper json format. 

In order to route data properly to the correct pipeline, the `orgID` and `pipelineID` of your pipeline is required.  These can be found on your organizations page, and pipeline page, respectively

The body of the request requires that records be put in the `data` key in an array of json objects for each record.

Note:  when including multiple records, the format requires a valid json payload, including comma separated values for records

#### Single record
```bash
{
  "data":[
    {}
  ]
}
```
#### Multiple Records
```bash
{
  "data":[
    {},
    {},
    {}
  ]
}
```

## Configuration
The following configuration defines the input parameters. Each field's specifications, such as type, requirements, and descriptions, are detailed below.

#### Settings

None.

#### Secrets

None.

## API

To send a `POST` request to create this Monad HTTP Connector:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '{base_url}/api/v2/{org_id}/inputs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "config": {
    "secrets": {},
    "settings": {}
  },
  "description": "input_description",
  "name": "input_name",
  "promise_id": "",
  "type": "monad-logs"
}'
```

### Python Example
```bash
import requests
import json

url = 'https://app.monad.com/api/v2/http/send'
headers = {
    'accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': my_bearer_token,
    'Monad-Org-Id': my_org_ID,
    'Monad-Pipeline-Id': my_pipeline_id
}
data = {
    'data': [
        {
            'dummy-key': 'dummy-data'
        }
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
