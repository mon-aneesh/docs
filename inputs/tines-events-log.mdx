title: Tines Events Log
description: >
  Retrieve a list of events from your Tines tenant.
---

## Details
Monad uses the `since` filter on the [api](https://www.tines.com/api/events/list/) to determine which events to display. This field is updated every time a request to get events is successful with the last time a request to get events was initiated. If this was the first time requesting for events data, a full sync of the data is performed.

## Prerequisites

***Before you connect Monad to Tines, you need an API Key and a Tenant URL.*** 

1. [Sign up for a Tines tenant to get a Tenant URL](https://login.tines.com/signup) if you aren't already a customer.
2. Follow the instructions in the following link from Tines to generate an API Key to allow API access to event data - https://www.tines.com/api/authentication/

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
