title: Slack Users
description: >
  Lists all users in a Slack team.

## Details
Monad uses the `cron` field to schedule the input at specific intervals, returning all users across teams if no team ID is specified, or limiting the scope to a specific team if a team ID is provided. In both cases, a full data sync is performed each time.

## Prerequisites
- Before you connect Monad to Slack, you need an API token. 
- Your API token needs to scoped to `users:read` to run this input connector.
- To obtain an API Token, you need to have a slack app. 

**To create a Slack app:**

- On the Your [Apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps), select Create New App.
- Select From scratch.
- Enter your appropriate App Name. 
- Select the Workspace where you'll be developing your app. You'll be able to distribute your app to other workspaces later if you choose.
- Select Create App.

**Configuring Permissions within your app**:

- Within OAuth & Permissions, scroll down to Scopes.
- Under Bot/User Token Scopes, select Add an OAuth Scope.
- To allow connection of Monad to Slack for this input connector, add the `users:read` scope.

## Configuration
The following configuration defines the input parameters. Each field's specifications, such as type, requirements, and descriptions, are detailed below.

#### Settings

| Setting | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| Cron | string | Yes | Cron string for scheduling tasks. Ex: '0 0 * * *' for daily execution at midnight. |

#### Secrets

| Secret | Type | Required | Description |

    "secrets": {
        "token": {
         "name": "Slack Token",
         "description": "Authentication token for Slack API",
         "value": "<TOKEN>"
       }
    },

  },

}'
```

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
