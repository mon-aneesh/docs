title: Semgrep Code Findings
description: >
  Collects and reports code vulnerabilities and compliance issues identified by Semgrep's static analysis rules across various programming languages and configurations.

### Details
Monad uses the `since` filter on the [API](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#tag/Finding/operation/semgrep_app.core_exp.findings.handlers.issue.openapi_list_recent_issues) to determine which findings to display. This field is updated every time a request to get findings is successful with the last time a request to get findings was initiated. If this was the first time requesting for findings, a full sync of the data is performed.
### Prerequisites
- Before you connect Monad to Semgrep, you need an API token. API tokens are scoped to include all code findings from a specific account in Semgrep.
- Please make sure that your account is on [Semgrep Code Team tier](https://semgrep.dev/docs/usage-and-billing#integrations-and-notifications) to have access to the API endpoints.
- To generate a new Semgrep API key,
- Log in to Semgrep, and check to confirm which account you are using. If needed, switch to the account that you want to connect to Monad.
- Click Settings > Tokens > Create new token.
- In the dialog that appears, make sure that WebAPI is selected and Agent (CI) is deselected in the Token Scopes section: [Semgrep setup documentation](https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/docs/#section/Authentication)
- In the Description, enter something like Monad Connector token so that it's clear later what this token is for.
- Copy the Secrets Value (the token value) to a secure place so you can use it to set up the connector. Once you close this dialog, you cannot view the token value again.

## Configuration
The following configuration defines the input parameters. Each field's specifications, such as type, requirements, and descriptions, are detailed below.

#### Settings

None.

#### Secrets

| Secret | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| API Key | string | Yes | API Key for the Semgrep API. This is required to authenticate requests. |

## API

To send a `POST` request to create this Semgrep Connector:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '{base_url}/api/v2/{org_id}/inputs' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{

# OCSF Conversion

The following JQ transformation converts Semgrep Code Finding data to OCSF Version 1.1.0 compliant format.

## JQ Transformation
```jq
{
  class_uid: 2002, # Vulnerability Finding
  category_uid: 2, # Findings
  type_uid: 200200, # Vulnerability Finding: Unknown
  activity_id: 0, # Unknown
  severity_id: (.severity | if . == "medium" then 2 else if . == "high" then 3 else if . == "critical" then 4 else 1 end end end),
  time: (.created_at | sub("\\.[0-9]+"; "") | fromdateiso8601),
  cloud: {
    provider: "Unknown",
    account: { name: .repository.name }
  },
  finding_info: {
    uid: .id | tostring,
    title: .rule_name,
    desc: .rule_message,
    first_seen_time: (.relevant_since | sub("\\.[0-9]+"; "") | fromdateiso8601)
  },
  vulnerabilities: [{
    desc: .rule_message,
    severity: .severity,
    title: .rule_name,
    vendor_name: "Semgrep",
    first_seen_time: (.relevant_since | sub("\\.[0-9]+"; "") | fromdateiso8601),

    cwe: {
      uid: (if .rule.cwe_names and .rule.cwe_names[0] then (.rule.cwe_names[0] | split("-")[1]) else null end),
      caption: (if .rule.cwe_names and .rule.cwe_names[0] then (.rule.cwe_names[0] | split(":")[1]) else null end)
    },

        type_id: 0 #Unknown
      },
      start_line: .location.line,
      end_line: .location.end_line
    }],
    references: .rule.owasp_names
  }],
  raw_data: (. | tostring),

```

## OCSF Mapping Details

The JQ transformation converts Semgrep Code Findings to OCSF Version 1.1.0 with the following key mappings:

### Core Fields
- **Class UID**: Set to 2002 (Vulnerability Finding)
- **Category UID**: Set to 2 (Findings)
- **Type UID**: Set to 200200 (Vulnerability Finding: Unknown)
- **Activity ID**: Set to 0 (Unknown)
- **Severity ID**: Mapped from Semgrep severity levels:
    - critical → 4
    - high → 3
    - medium → 2
    - others → 1 (Low)
- **Time**: Extracted from `created_at` field with milliseconds stripped

### Cloud Information
- **Provider**: Set to "Unknown"
- **Account Name**: Maps from repository name

### Finding Information
- **UID**: Finding ID converted to string
- **Title**: Maps from rule name
- **Description**: Maps from rule message
- **First Seen Time**: Converted from `relevant_since` timestamp

### Vulnerability Details
- **Description**: Maps from rule message
- **Severity**: Maps directly from Semgrep severity
- **Title**: Maps from rule name
- **Vendor Name**: Set to "Semgrep"
- **Time Information**:
    - First Seen: Converted from `relevant_since`
    - Last Seen: Converted from `created_at`
- **CWE Information**:
    - UID: Extracted from first CWE name (after "-")
    - Caption: Extracted from first CWE name (after ":")
- **Affected Code**:
    - File Path: Full file path
    - File Name: Extracted from last segment of path
    - Line Numbers: Start and end lines from location data
- **References**: Maps from OWASP names in rule

### Metadata
- **Version**: Set to "1.1.0"
- **Product**:
    - Vendor name: "Semgrep"
    - Name: "Semgrep"

- ### Customization
The transformation serves as a starting point and can be modified to accommodate specific requirements while maintaining OCSF compliance.
The mapping prioritizes essential asset information and cloud provider detection while providing fallback values for optional fields.
