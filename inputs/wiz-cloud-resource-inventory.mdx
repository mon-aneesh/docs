title: Wiz Cloud Resource Inventory 
description: >
  Collects and processes Cloud Resource Inventory logs from the Wiz API.
---

## Details
Monad connects to the Wiz API to collect cloud resource inventory data. The connector operates in two modes:

- Initial Report: When running for the first time, the connector creates a new Cloud Resource Inventory report. It waits for the report generation to complete, and processes the resulting CSV data and sends it forward.

- Incremental Sync Mode: For subsequent runs, the connector fetches all data **since** the report was first generated, and retrieves only cloud resources that were updated after this timestamp using the updatedAt filter on the Wiz API.

The connector also supports filtering by cloud platform and entity type.

## Prerequisites
- Before connecting Monad to Wiz, you need to obtain API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret). These credentials allow access to the Wiz API to fetch cloud resource inventory.
- Ensure that your Wiz credentials have the appropriate permissions to access the necessary API endpoints. To access Cloud resource inventory specifically, make sure your credentials have `create:reports`, `update:reports` and `read:resources`

## Custom Schema Handling

If the source data doesn't align with any of the [OpenSecurityControlFramework (OSCF) schemas](https://github.com/ocsf), you can create a custom transformation using our JQ transform pipeline. For example:

```jq
{
  metadata: {
    schema_version: "1.0.0",
    custom_framework: "my_framework"
  },
  controls: .[]
}
```

For more information on JQ and how to write your own JQ transformations see the JQ docs [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

If you believe this data source should be included in the standard OSCF schema set, please reach out to our team at [support@monad.com](mailto:support@monad.com). We're always looking to expand our coverage of security control frameworks based on community needs.
